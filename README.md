# 🅿️ ParkingHole

**ParkingHole** is a Final Degree Project (TFG) focused on the development of an application that facilitates the search, reservation, and offering of parking spaces in both urban areas and private parking lots across Spain.

The main goal is to **optimize time and space** in cities by allowing users to share or find available parking spots in a simple, fast, and secure way.

---

## 🧭 General Overview

In many Spanish cities, finding a parking space represents a constant loss of time, fuel, and patience.  
**ParkingHole** aims to provide a practical solution to this problem through a collaborative platform where:

- Users can **offer their free parking spaces** for a specific period.  
- Other drivers can **reserve them** through a small micropayment.  
- The entire system promotes **trust, efficiency, and resource sharing** between users.

---

## 🇪🇸 Initial Scope

The project will begin its development and validation **within Spain**, with a special focus on urban areas and shopping centers.  
In the medium term, an expansion to other European countries with similar parking challenges may be considered.

---

## 🎯 Main Objectives

- Reduce the time drivers spend searching for parking.  
- Encourage a **collaborative economy** among users.  
- Promote a more rational use of existing parking spaces.  
- Serve as a technological foundation for future integration with **smart mobility services**.

## 💡 Current Project Status

This repository is created as the starting point for the **Final Degree Project in Computer Science**.  
It is currently in the **conceptual design and prototyping phase**, focused on:

- Defining the user experience (UX/UI).  
- Specifying the main flows for reservation, offering, and validation.  
- Collecting suggestions and ideas for future implementation.

---

## 🤝 How to Contribute

If you’re interested in contributing ideas or feedback about user experience, design, or system validation, you can do so by:

- Leaving comments and suggestions in the repository’s *issues* section.  
- Proposing improvements related to interaction, accessibility, or usability.  
- Providing feedback on potential use cases within the Spanish context.

> ⚠️ This repository is **not yet intended for technical implementation**,  
> but rather to consolidate the **overall vision and concept** of the application.

## 🌍 Future Vision

While **ParkingHole** begins as an academic project based in Spain, its concept and structure are designed with **global scalability** in mind. In the future, it could evolve into a large-scale international platform, helping cities around the world **reduce congestion, optimize space usage, and promote sustainable urban mobility.**
